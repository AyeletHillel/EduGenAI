# EduGenAI: An Educational Chatbot

Welcome to EduGenAI, a project that combines my two greatest passionsâ€”education and artificial intelligence. EduGenAI is a chatbot designed to assist 4th-grade students in their learning journey. It generates Free Response Questions (FRQ) based on a student's topic of interest and evaluates their answers.

### Features

* Dynamic FRQ Generation: Generates questions based on the student's topic of interest and predefined writing standards.

* Evaluation: Evaluates the student's response to the FRQ and provides feedback.

* Quality Check: Ensures the feedback provided is clear, relevant, and constructive for a 4th grader.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository. 
2. Install the required dependencies. `npm i`
3. Set up your .env file with necessary configurations. `OPEN_AI_API_KEY=YOUR-API-KEY`
4. Run the application. `npm run start`
